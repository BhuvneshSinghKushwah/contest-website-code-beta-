# Code-Beta Website
This website was created to facilitate college staff faculties in creating tests for the conduct of exams or hackathons. This website was used by 300+ students at once during an intercollege contest conducted by us.

There are also some helper websites we used for smooth conduction of the event; we used Firebase auth for login/signup and Firebase-store for storing the results of every student. The Helper website, which was also developed by us, used algorithms to fetch the results of each student and display them on the dashboard, as well as to email the score for the test to participants email addresses.

These helper/admin websites created a seamless experience for the staff to conduct hackathons and exams with ease. Also, hosting scripts were used to host the test locally on the LAN network between labs.

## Below are some of the photos we took from our event Code-Beta!!.
